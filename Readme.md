This document contains solutions for neetcode 150 problem. I plan to cover all 150 problems in coming 150days, doing one at a time.

# Day 1 - Contains duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears more than once in the array, otherwise return false.

# Day 2 - Anagrams
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Two approaches we used : 
- Hashmap
- Sorting

# Day 3 - Two sum
Given a array and target, find the index of element in array whose sum leads to the target.

Two approaches used. 
- Brute force
- One pass approach ( Using Dictionary )
